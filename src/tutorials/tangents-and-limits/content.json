        "text": "A tangent line is a line that <strong>shares one and only one point \\((x,y)\\)</strong> with another non-linear function.\n\nWhen we say sharing, we mean the following,\n\n$$\n\\text{Given any two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we say that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ share a given point $(p,q)$ if and only if $f(p) = g(p) = q$} \n$$\n\nIn regards to finding the equation of a tangent line, we are usually given a non-linear function \\(f(x)\\) and a point \\((p,q)\\) and we are asked to find \\(g(x)\\) which is the function of the tangent line.\n\nIf you are wondering what tangent lines are used for, that's a great question and a good place to start. Tangent lines help us find the slope of the curve at a specific point. As you move along a curve, the slope of that curve changes, so by finding the tangent line for a specific point on a curve, all we have to do is find the slope of that tangent line and we will know what the slope of the curve is at that specific point. Pretty clever right? \n\nSo now you are probably wondering what is the point of finding the slope of the curve at a specific point, and my answer to that is simple,because by finding the slope of the curve at a specific point, we are finding the rate at which the curve is changing.\n\nTo give you a real world example, suppose we were driving down a curvy road and we wanted to know what velocity was a specific point in time on the curvy road.
