    "openingStatement": "A tangent line is a line that 'touches' a point of another function (usually a curve). In other words, a tangent line is a linear function that <strong>shares one and only one point</strong> with another non-linear function.\n\nIn order to help us find the equation (linear function) of a tangent line, we can make use of what are known as Limits. We will go into more depth into what exactly is a limit later in this tutorial.",
